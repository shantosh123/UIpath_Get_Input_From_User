**Step-by-step guide**
Create robot which asks user to input car-data into a system. Robot asks for car license plate number, car brand, car year model, kilometers driven by car and engine type.
Robot stores these values into datatable.
Robot asks if user wants to input another car and offers "Yes" / "No" buttons.
After user has inputted information about 5 vehicles, user selects No. Robot then calculates, how many kilometers all the cars have been driven (a sum).
Robot then calculates, what is the average age of the cars.
Robot writes all the information gathered from user into a Excel Workbook. 
Robot adds additional information to Excel as seen in picture below.
